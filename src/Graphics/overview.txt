-> Render default window:
    -> Left side should have a separator
    -> Left side should have each task name evenly separated with the same x position and the y position increasing at constant intervals
    -> Bottom side should have a separator
    -> Each integer from 0 to supertime should have a label, evenly spaced at constant intervals on the x axes

-> Initialise startT and currTaskID
-> Read file line by line, splitting the line into three words.
    -> The first word is the time
    -> The second words is the task
    -> The third word is the command
    -> If the command is success:
        -> blue squares from startT to time on currTaskID
    -> If the command is miss:
        -> Red diamond at startT on currTaskID
        -> If task is currTaskID:
            -> blue Squares from startT to time on currTaskID 
    -> If the command is execute
        -> Change startT to time and currTaskID to task's id (index in list of names)

-> static rendering - no need for a main loop
